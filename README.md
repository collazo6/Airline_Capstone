The information that was gained from analyzing these reviews was very insightful and can be utilized in real world scenarios in order to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a company, utilize benchmarking on higher quality businesses to see how ones own company stacks up, and understand how external events and the human psychological reaction can have an effect on the perception of quality of a product.
